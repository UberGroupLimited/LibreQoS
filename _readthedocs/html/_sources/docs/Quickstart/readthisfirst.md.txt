## Network Design Assumptions - Read this First!
Officially supported configuration:
- LibreQoS placed inline in network, usually between an edge router (NAT, firewall) and core router (distribution to sites across network).
    * If you use NAT/CG-NAT, place LibreQoS inline south of where NAT is applied, as LibreQoS needs to shape internal addresses (100.64.0.0/12) not public post-NAT IPs.
- Edge and Core routers should have 1500 MTU on links between them
- If you use MPLS, you would terminate MPLS traffic at the core router. LibreQoS cannot decapsulate MPLS on its own.
- OSPF primary link (low cost) through the server running LibreQoS
- OSPF backup link (high cost, maybe 200 for example)

Is it possible to use LibreQoS in-line without a core router, but that setup requires depending on STP instead of OSPF, which can cause issues. Such configurations are not officially supported.

### Network Interface Card
You must have one of these:
    *single NIC with two interfaces,
    *two NICs with single interface,
    *2x VLANs interface (using one or two NICs).

LibreQoS requires NICs to have 2 or more RX/TX queues and XDP support. While many cards theoretically meet these requirements, less commonly used cards tend to have unreported driver bugs which impede XDP functionality and make them unusable for our purposes. At this time we recommend the Intel x520, Intel x710, and Nvidia (ConnectX-5 or newer) NICs. We cannot guarantee compatibility with other cards.
