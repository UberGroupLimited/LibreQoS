## Integrations

### Splynx Integration

First, set the relevant parameters for Splynx (splynx_api_key, splynx_api_secret, etc.) in ispConfig.py.

To test the Splynx Integration, use
```
python3 integrationSplynx.py
```
On the first successful run, it will create a ShapedDevices.csv file.
You can manually create your network.json file to more accurately reflect bandwidth limits.
ShapedDevices.csv will be overwritten every time the Splynx integration is run.
You have the option to run integrationSplynx.py automatically on boot and every 30 minutes, which is recommended. This can be enabled by setting ```automaticImportSplynx = True``` in ispConfig.py
